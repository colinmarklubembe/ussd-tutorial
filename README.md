## Introduction

USSD is a communication protocol used by GSM cellular telephones to communicate with the service provider's computers. This tutorial demonstrates how to create a USSD application and integrate it with backend services.

## Features

- Step-by-step USSD application development.
- Integration with backend APIs.
- Example use cases for real-world applications.
- Easy-to-follow code samples.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of programming.
- A development environment (e.g., Node.js).
- Access to a USSD gateway or simulator (e.g., Africa's Talking).
- MongoDB installed and running locally or on a cloud service.
- Mongoose library for MongoDB integration.
- Access to a USSD gateway or simulator (e.g. Africa's Talking).

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/colinmarklubembe/ussd-tutorial.git
   cd ussd-tutorial
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Bun:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Configure your USSD gateway settings in the `.env` file if any.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   bun run start
   ```

## Usage

- Test your USSD application using a simulator or a real USSD gateway.
- Customize the code to fit your specific use case.
